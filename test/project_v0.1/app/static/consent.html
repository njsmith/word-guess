    <p>
      Professor Roger Levy is conducting research to find out more about how
      people process written and spoken language, as well as other forms of
      auditory and visual information. There will be approximately 100
      participants in the study.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you agree to be in this study, the following may happen. You may be
      asked to fill out a short background questionnaire, which will take a
      few minutes. You may then be presented with one or more written or
      spoken words or sentences, images, and/or sounds. You may be asked to
      press buttons in response to these stimuli in order to indicate
      comprehension, to provide ratings or other judgments, or to answer
      questions regarding what you see and/or hear. All stimuli and responses
      will be of a generally inoffensive nature. If you have any questions
      before consenting, please contact Professor Roger Levy at rlevy@ucsd.edu
      or Nathaniel Smith at nathaniel.smith@ed.ac.uk.

      discomforts. There is also a slight risk of boredom, although many
      participants find participation in this study interesting. Your data
      will remain anonymous.
